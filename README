README for tactus-navigation
tactus-navigation: Copyright 2009, Ryan Pavlik <ryan.pavlik@snc.edu>

tactus-navigation is a task-management interface designed for Linux computers
using standard keyboard, mouse, and display, as well as a multi-touch display
(preferably horizontal and opposite the mouse, for bimanual input).  The
multi-touch display is used as a navigation display to manipulate running
tasks in naturally-arranged groups: "piles."

This project has its start in a St. Norbert College Computer Science CS460
Senior Capstone project course.  The corresponding web site (for the
combined hardware-software system) is http://compsci.snc.edu/cs460/pavlra/

This project's code is hosted on GitHub - the canonical version is at:
http://github.com/rpavlik/tactus/tree/master

Quickstart:
-----------
0. Get this software somehow: either use a .tar.gz download from GitHub or
clone it using the public git url shown there.

1. Start by installing the rp-mt-scripts: you only really need pymt (you can
partially use it with the mouse multi-touch emulation included in pymt) but
for best results run the full default install script.

Check out the CS460 page for rp-mt-scripts:
http://compsci.snc.edu/cs460/pavlra/software/rp-mt-scripts/

or soon-to-be better, the project page on GitHub:
http://github.com/rpavlik/rp-mt-scripts/tree/master

2. Make sure you have pymt installed and updated using rp-mt-scripts!  The
pymt package must be installed (apt-cache policy pymt to make sure.)

3. Run tbeta (in rp-mt-scripts, ./run_tbeta.sh , hit b to save background,
and hit space to go to mini mode) if you are using an actual mt device.  No
need to run FLOSC since this isn't written in Flash.

4. Run mainpymt.py:
cd whereveryouclonedtactus/py
./mainpymt.py

5. Have fun!  Hit esc to exit until I have a more clever way set up.

Requirements:
-------------
 - Ubuntu 9.04 or similar Linux that works well with PyMT.  8.10 works but
	needs some source packages backported from 9.04, which is why I
	recommend the newer version.

 - python-gtk2, python-gnome2-desktop

 - (Recommended) rp-mt-scripts to install the latest pymt as a debian package
	as well as other software needed if you actually have an MT surface.

 - A recent (probably SVN) version of PyMT http://pymt.txzone.net/
	rp-mt-scripts can automatically install the latest as a debian package,
	which should probably work just spiffy!

	(It does need to be installed system-wide so at least use checkinstall
	to make a package when installing so you can cleanly remove it.)

	Tested compatible SVN revisions of PyMT:
	(rp-mt: pymt package version 0.0.rev-datebuilt, we only care about rev)
	
	801  (back to 799 should also be fine too, at least - didn't see any
		important core changes when I just built a new package.)

	Of course, I see now that they just moved to Mercurial for source
	control, so the rp-mt-scripts will be ported sooner or later.  GitHub
	will always have the latest.
