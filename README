This version: v1.0.1 - Released 10 May 2009

About:
------
tactus-navigation is a task-management interface designed for Linux computers
using standard keyboard, mouse, and display, as well as a multi-touch display
(preferably horizontal and opposite the mouse, for bimanual input).  The
multi-touch display is used as a navigation display to manipulate running
tasks in naturally-arranged groups: "piles."

This project has its start in a St. Norbert College Computer Science CS460
Senior Capstone project course.  The corresponding web site (for the
combined hardware-software system) is http://compsci.snc.edu/cs460/pavlra/

This project's code is hosted on GitHub - the canonical version is at:
http://github.com/rpavlik/tactus/

Quickstart:
-----------
0. Get this software somehow: either use a .tar.gz download from GitHub or
clone it using the public git url shown there.

1. Start by installing the rp-mt-scripts: you only really need pymt (you can
partially use it with the mouse multi-touch emulation included in pymt) but
for best results run the full default install script.

Check out the CS460 page for rp-mt-scripts:
http://compsci.snc.edu/cs460/pavlra/software/rp-mt-scripts/

or the project page on GitHub for the latest release:
http://github.com/rpavlik/rp-mt-scripts/

2. Make sure you have pymt installed and updated using rp-mt-scripts!  The
pymt package must be installed - the install script will check.

3. Install tactus from where you downloaded or cloned it by running install.sh.
Either start it in a terminal, or choose Run in Terminal when double-clicking,
since it will need you to enter your password to install required packages.

4. Run tbeta (in rp-mt-scripts/scripts, ./run_tbeta_1.1.sh , hit b to save
background, and hit space to go to mini mode) if you are using an actual mt
device.  No need to run FLOSC since this isn't written in Flash.

5. Run ./tactus-navigator from wherever you installed the tactus download.
	(This is a symbolic link to mainpymt.py - you can run the file directly:
	cd whereveryouclonedtactus/py
	./mainpymt.py
	and it does the same thing.)

6. Have fun!  Hit esc or press the "exit" button to exit.

Requirements:
-------------
 - Ubuntu 9.04 or similar Linux that works well with PyMT.  8.10 works but
	needs some source packages backported from 9.04, which is why I
	recommend the newer version.

 - python-gtk2, python-gnome2-desktop

 - (Recommended) rp-mt-scripts to install the latest pymt as a debian package
	as well as other software needed if you actually have an MT surface.

 - A recent (probably development) version of PyMT http://pymt.txzone.net/
	rp-mt-scripts can automatically install the latest as a debian package,
	which should probably work just spiffy!

	(It does need to be installed system-wide so at least use checkinstall
	to make a package when installing so you can cleanly remove it.)

	If you have anything since subversion revision 801, including any
	mercurial ("Hg") version, it will be new enough - just use the scripts.
