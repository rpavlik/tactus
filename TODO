Bugs/Todo/Ideas:
---------------
 - Script to set sync-blank for the second screen
 - Fix boundary-handling to check if window is in the bar
 - Make sure we use global/absolute coords instead of local when checking position of widget with regard to the bar
 - Ensure that adding a canvassedwindow to a canvassedpile removes it from the pilecanvas on its own to prevent image duplication and weirdness when handling events.
 - Determine if a canvassedpile should be a MTScatterPlane (infinite size???) or MTScatterWidget/Svg (limited size)
 - Improve placing windows initially - use something other than uniform random coordinates.
 - add rotate support and buttons to control rotation (permitting 180 and 90 deg rotates to make image sensible to user)
 - Put all restored windows into one pile?
 - Simple reclustering algorithm conducted after on_touch_up
 - svg as wallpaper (patch to pymt?)
 - don't permit windows to be thrown offscreen (patch to pymt MTKinetic, as an optional behavior?)
 - allow kinetic windows to be "caught" (patch to pymt MTKinetic, as an optional behavior?)
 - move windows to/from bar when getting an update-state that changes status
 - double-tap to bring to front
 - Permanently enable piles
 - "flip" action to offer additional options for each canvassedwindow
